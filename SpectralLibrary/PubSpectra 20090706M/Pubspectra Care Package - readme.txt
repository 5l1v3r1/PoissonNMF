I have now consolidated all the spectra into a single Excel 2007 “big grid” file:

McNamara Boswell PubSpectra 20090427M (Excel 2007).xlsx

As of July 2009, PubSpectra is hosted at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Analytical Imaging Core Facility (AICF) web site:

http://www.sylvester.org/AICF/PubSpectra

If you are not using Excel 2007, Microsoft has a couple of options:

Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Office XP and 2003

A couple of other files you may find useful:

Table(s) of fluorescent proteins excitation and emission maxima, extinction coefficient, quantum yield, and amino acid sequence (the “aa” part of the filename):
McNamara Boswell 20090514 DATA - FPaa Fluorescent Proteins Data Table.xls
  With new FP’s being published every month, not completely up to date. Spectra are NOT in FPaa, they are in the PubSpectra xlsx file.

A table of over 5000 fluorescent dyes with and emission maxima, extinction coefficient, quantum yield (when available):
McNamara 20070818A DATA - McNamara 2007 Fluorophores Table.xls

You might also get a kick out of McNamara 2009 MPMicro.doc (in “More Stuff”). Please save a few trees by not hitting print!
