### Blind decomposition of spectrally resolved data – single excitation

Documentation is available as html in the Documentation folder. The plug-In can be found in the ImageJ/NMF folder.

### Blind decomposition of spectrally resolved data – multiple excitation
Documentation is available as html in the Documentation folder. The plug-In can be found in the ImageJ/NTF folder.

### Optimize your choice of excitation wavelength and spectra channel
Documentation is available as html in the Documentation folder. The plug-In can be found in the ImageJ/OAS folder.

### Library of spectra
All our plug-ins use a library of spectra. A sample library of spectra is available, mostly by George McNamara.
